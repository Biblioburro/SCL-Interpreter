# SCL-Interpreter
This is for class CS4308 written by @TsunamiMonsoon, @Biblioburro and @Joshua

The goal of the project is to create a Scanner for the first deliverable,
a Parser for the second deliverable and an Interpreter for the third
deliverable for the SCL language. 

Everything is written in Java, but used for the SCL language.

To use the Scanner you need the Scanner class, Token class and the Main class;
then add your file path to the Main class and run. It should print the token
names to each corresponding token. 

To use the Parser...(will be added later)

To use the Interpreter...(will be added later)
